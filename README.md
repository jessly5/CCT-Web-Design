### Web Culture and Design (January - April 2018)
This course is an introduction to HTML, CSS, and website design principles. Though the HTML and CSS taught were very bare bone and boring, the design principles were interesting to learn. 

Specifically:
  - Creation of personas (resarching the target audiences and creating their profiles)
  - Information architecture (website hierarchy, Dan Brown's *Eight Principles of IA*, Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think*)
  - Wireframing
  - Website navigation terms

### Intermediate Web Design (May - June 2018)
This course builds upon the skills and ideas introduced in CCT260. Even though I took this during the summer, (which meant that we were learning at twice the speed of a regular fall/winter course), the interesting content made up for it. I was very happy to hear that other students also enjoyed the class content. The content varies based on the instructor's interest, and my instructor decided on Bootstrap. (A syllabus from a previous instructor seemed to focus more on WordPress and PHP).

The content could be summarized as:
  - HTML and CSS tips and tricks (CSS combinators, box sizing, etc)
  - Bootstrap and its features (grid, carousel, etc)
  - Accesibility (such as WCAG)
  - Adaptive and responsive websites (Bootstrap grid, HTML viewport and CSS for mobile, etc)

### Advanced Web Design (January - April 2019)
In this course, we learned about:
  - How the Internet works at a high level (client and server relationship, ports, URL)
  - WordPress (the value of a CMS, installing WP onto our own host, creating a child theme, Gutenberg editor, injecting custom HTML)
  - Foundational web analytics (web analytics terminology, adding a global site tag into our website for Google Analytics)
  - Introduction to APIs (specifically the use of Google Map API)
  - Beginner JavaScript
  
In my opinion, the foundatoinal web analytics content was the most interesting part of the course. I also found that this course didn't really build up from the previous x60 courses. Instead, it assumes that we will apply our HTML/CSS and UI/UX knowledge gained from them into the assignments. Additionally, this course was much easier than 260/360 due to the use of WordPress instead of handling HTML/CSS directly.
