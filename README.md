## CCT260
### Web Culture and Design (January - April 2018)
This course is an introduction to HTML, CSS, and website design principles. Though the HTML and CSS taught were very bare bone and boring, the design principles were interesting to learn. 

Specifically:
  - Creation of personas (profiles created based on target audience research)
  - Information architecture (website hierarchy, Dan Brown's *Eight Principles of IA*, Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think*)
  - Wireframing
  - Website navigation terms

### Intermediate Web Design (May - June 2018)
This course builds upon the skills and ideas introduced in CCT260. Even though I took this during the summer, (which meant that we were learning at twice the speed of a regular fall/winter course), the interesting content made up for it. I was very happy to hear that other students also enjoyed the class content. The content varies based on the instructor's interest, and my instructor decided on Bootstrap. (A syllabus from a previous instructor seemed to focus more on WordPress and PHP).

The content could be summarized as:
  - HTML and CSS tips and tricks (CSS combinators, box sizing, etc)
  - Bootstrap and its features (grid, carousel, etc)
  - Accesibility (such as WCAG)
  - Adaptive and responsive websites (Bootstrap grid, HTML viewport and CSS for mobile, etc)
