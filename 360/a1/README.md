# CCT360 - Assignment 1

For this assignment, I decided to recreate Arro Home's website. We were not required to recreate all of the pages, so the only completed pages are: home page, about us, and shipping information. To see my process work [click here](cct360-a1-process.pdf).

Arro Home: https://www.arrohome.com

You can view my replica website live [here](https://jessly5.github.io/CCT-Web-Design/360/a1/).
