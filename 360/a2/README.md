# CCT360 - Assignment 2

For this assignment, I decided to recreate Square One Shopping Centre's website. We were not required to recreate all of the pages, so the only completed pages are: home page, tourism, and visit. To see my process work [click here](cct360-a2-process.pdf).

Square One Shopping Centre: https://shopsquareone.com
